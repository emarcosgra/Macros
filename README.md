# Macros

Semi-automated macros to quantify the contralateral projections of the somatosensory area in coronal sections of mouse cerebral cortex, relative to the ipsilateral area

- The first macro (IUE_ipsi_SS_count_licensed) enables to quantify the number GFP+ neurons in electroporated somatosensory area

- The second macro (IUE_contra_SS_count_licensed) enables to quantify the mean fluorescence of the axonal projections in the contralateral area, dividing it into  medial, S1-S2 column, intercolumn and S2 column regions.
