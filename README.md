# Macros

Semi-automated macros to quantify the contralateral projections of the somatosensory area relative to the ipsilateral area in coronal sections of mouse cerebral cortex

- First, use the IUE_ipsi_SS_count_licensed macro to quantify the number GFP+ neurons in electroporated somatosensory area.

- Next, use the IUE_contra_SS_count_licensed macro  to quantify the fluorescence of GFP+ axons of the somatosensory area, distinguishing the medial, S1-S2 column, intercolumn and S2 column regions.

In both cases, the user shall review the quantification and correct any errors.
